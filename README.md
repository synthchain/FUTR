The FUTR of Crypto
1.0 FUTR & Other Futereum Innovations
1.1 Futereum Foundation Blockchain Build-out Objectives
The Futereum Project has three Blockchain build-out objectives:
1) Build a replica Ether-equivalent token with a dramatically-reduced
supply for use within a more financially-sophisticated community of
adopters (FUTR) in order to expand the use-case of the Ethereum
network in terms of initiating new value-events. This is in response to
similar expansions of smart-enabled Blockchain technology use-case
expansions that have been taking place with respect to the
development of currencies such as XRP, EOS, ICX etc.
2) Build for purchasers of the Futereum digital currencies a more
equitably-distributed ownership of Ether which is the digital currency of
the Blockchain which Futereum is powered by. At the same time, we
acknowledge that earlier and more active participants in the FUTR
mining process should receive a disproportionate share of this
equitable distribution of Ether.
3) Build a range of value-enhanced utility tokens that are powered by the
Ethereum Virtual Machine and run multiple Futereum Smart Contracts
as a result of harnessing the combination of the primary two aims on
PoW-style mining protocol algorithms. Our aim is to empower the
value-enhancement potential we believe is inherent in the Ethereum
smart contract solution source code and which we think is currently
being underemployed to a very substantial degree in terms of the core
development of next-generation Blockchain solutions.
1.2 Use of Phi Algorithm to Simulate PoW Mining Effect
The Fibonacci sequence is a numerical order based on the algebraic function
Phi first discovered by Leonardo Pisano and published the Italian
mathematician’s 1202 book Liber Abacci.
5
The ratio comprises a mathematical formula whereby the previous two
numbers in the sequence combine to give the result of the subsequent
answer to the equation ad infinitum:
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
3 + 5 = 8
5 + 8 = 13
8+ 13 = 21
13 + 21 = 34
21 + 34 = 55
34 + 55 = 89
55 + 89 = 114
etc.
The sequence was first postulated by Pisano as a means to understanding
the potential infinite increase of rabbit populations in rural areas, and it is
today used to underpin many of the world’s most sophisticated financial
markets trading algorithms.
A wide number of professional Crypto traders also rely heavily and in some
cases exclusively on Fibonacci-regressive technical analysis today to
formulate alpha-generating trading ideas and approaches.
Futereum Smart Contracts must contain two apparently contradictory
functions which must be equally satisfied in order to justify the utility of the
tokens that are purchased in the form of Futereum Utility Tokens. Those
functions are the ones as set out in our second Blockchain build-out
objective:
Function 1 = The smart contract results in a more equitable distribution
of Ether than before it was employed by the user
Function 2 = Initial miners and high-frequency miners of Futereum
Smart Contract tokens should stand to benefit more from this equitable
distribution
The paradox is resolved by means of employing a Fibonacci equation inside
the mining algorithm of the Futereum Smart Contract.
In the event of the Futereum Smart Contract for Ether (FUTR), we employed
the equation as an expression of the amount of FUTR an ETH receives in the
process of mining the smart contract.
6
We achieved this by progressively decreasing the amount of FUTR mined per
ETH sent to the smart contract as the mining level is increased:
Level FUTR FUTR/ETH ETH
1 1,000,000 114 8,772
2 990,000 89 11,124
3 960,000 55 17,455
4 910,000 34 26,765
5 720,000 21 34,286
6 650,000 13 50,000
7 560,000 8 70,000
8 450,000 5 90,000
9 320,000 3 106,667
10 170,000 2 85,000
Total 6,730,000 - 500,067
In the example above, which represents the actual number of Ether employed
in the mining of the FUTR smart contract, 1 million FUTR initially distributed
across a range of miners who collectively contribute 8,772 ETH;
subsequently, 990,000 FUTR are mined by a total of 11, 124 ETH etc.
Naturally, the progressive difficulty (cost) of the mining process is only
compounded by any price increase in ETH.
In this way, the Fibonacci equation driving the FUTR mining algorithm of this
Futereum Smart Contract creates an identical mining effect to Proof-of-Work
(PoW) mining, where difficulty of a coin’s mining is subject to two factors,
those being the cost of the unit of value being mined and the relative age of
the Blockchain at the point of mining.
To date, we have not been able to discover a more efficient mining protocol
type than PoW. PoW is such an effective method of digital currency mining
precisely because over time it forces the miners into higher cost-per-unit
mining equations, resulting in an intrinsically higher cost (price) per coin.
Economically this process produces a greater expansion of the network
underlying the mining process.
This PoW-likeness of the FUTR does not in itself result in a more equitable
distribution of Ether to the FUTR miners however. Therefore, to achieve this
using the Fibonacci sequence we employed in the smart contract
development, we embedded an exchange function at the end of a fixed
period in time after the last mining of the smart contract took place.
7
If all the FUTR produced by the smart contract is mined in under a 12-month
period, then at the end of month 13 a temporary function is enabled in the
smart contract whereby a FUTR holder is given a brief period of time to
exchange the amount of FUTR held for a percentile-wise equivalent amount
of ETH held in the smart contract since the point when the FUTR was mined.
This percentage-equitable exchange of FUTR with ETH held in the smart
contract, when combined with the Fibonacci equation that is the basis of our
mining algorithm, results in simultaneous equitable distribution of Ether to
FUTR holders as well as preferential treatment of early and regular FUTR
miners, since those who mined FUTR in the initial period of the smart
contract and those who mined FUTR when ETH was relatively cheaper in
value and who are thereby likely to be the most active miners gain more than
late-stage one-off miners of FUTR.
1.3 Non-Premined Approach: Fee-Enabled Mining Solution
It has been a relatively popular occurrence recently for developers of
Blockchain and smart contracts to premine a portion of the token supply as a
means of rewarding themselves or the foundations they represent in financial
terms for the work undertaken at point of development.
We are uncomfortable with the concept of premine for the reason that it
tends to lead to a moral hazard effect, whereby the party who is the
beneficiary of the premined tokens is usually excessively rewarded versus
those holders who either mined the tokens or who purchase the tokens on an
exchange. As a direct consequence of premine containing such a developerbiased
value function, core developers who ought to be safeguarding the
value of the projects they undertake to build frequently accept offers for their
tokens on exchanges which are far below an acceptable market price for that
of their customers, and this substantially undermines the utility token price
over time.
Therefore, instead of premining the FUTR smart contract, we developed a fee
schedule based on achievement of actual mining levels being achieved over
time. Assuming 10 Levels of mining difficulty being achieved over 12 months,
with an additional one-off charge for product development, the fee schedules
we developed is as follows:
• Monthly Charge: 0.4% for Month 1-12 (there is no fee for additional
months)
• Level Cost: 0.6% per Level 1-10
• Administrative Fee: 5%
8
These fees, which comprise a total of 15%, are removed at source upon
mining of the FUTR in ETH tokens. We find this a more effective approach to
rewarding the smart contract developers and the foundation than the
premining alternative, principally because it incentivises us to mine and hold
FUTR with the ETH received by way of the small fee payments charged
instead of selling out the order books on exchange with the premined tokens.
1.4 Renewable Life of FUTR & Whitelisted Product Roll-Out
Despite its futures-contract enabled value functionality, FUTR is first and
foremost a utility token which enables the miner to partake in forthcoming
next-generation Futereum product releases (see Part 8: Roadmap for specific
guideline dates). Therefore, once the exchange of FUTR-ETH has taken
place, the smart contract enables a new cycle of product development to
begin via starting anew from the 144 FUTR per ETH Level 1 mining algorithm.
Several possibilities emerge here:
Possibility 1 is that a large amount of ether is retained inside the smart
contract due to a lot of un-swapped FUTR. If this is the case then all
remaining Ether will reside in the smart contract for the duration of the next
cycle whereupon it will contribute to the increased amount of ETH swapped
per FUTR. Combined with the inevitable occurrence of a decrease in
circulating supply of FUTR due to FUTR getting lost in the usual ways (being
sent to wrong wallet, holder of wallet losing private key etc.) we see this
aspect of FUTR product design as holding a substantial long-term economic
benefit for FUTR.
Possibility 2 is that many late-stage FUTR miners will mine the requisite
minimum FUTR not in order to partake in the exchange of FUTR for ETH at
the end of the current mining cycle but rather to take advantage of future
product releases. We are especially excited about this aspect of the FUTR for
it justifies the product’s core utility as that of a token which enables
participation in the Futereum ecosystem and doesn’t just function as a
Blockchain-enabled utility-focused futures contract equivalent (although this
economic benefit of holding the token very much exists and will appeal to a
large number of FUTR miners).
Possibility 3 is that the next-generation Futereum product releases will have
to be significantly more complex in terms of their mining algorithm build-out
as a direct consequence of encouraging people to mine FUTR tokens to take
advantage of the new product launches. We have prepared for this event and
indeed, FUTR-A, FUTR-B etc. product releases can be expected to have
game-changing swaps utility functions that are not yet even available on
Blockchain. At this point in time we have fully-designed the next Futereum
9
product release (around April – June; see Section 8: Roadmap for more) and
are working on the second smart contract presently.
In summary, FUTR has economic benefits for both unique miners of the
tokens (those who would mine FUTR purely to exchange the token for Ether
at the end of the term) and significant further upside for those looking to rise
the wave of future Futereum product releases.

2.0 Background of FUTR
2.1 Evidence of Market Preparedness for Introduction of FUTR
With the advent of futures contracts for Bitcoin being offered by CBOE and
CME, utility tokens on the Blockchain that have leveraged product
assimilation are an inevitable next-stage introduction. The increasing volumes
of Top 10 Coin Market Cap listed Crypto are drawing attention from a wider
financial audience and as these volumes continue to rise, so will the interest
from financial markets investors follow suit.
2.1 Development of Futereum Utility Tokens for Ether (FUTR)
A $100 investment made at the start of the year when spread across what
were in January 2017 the leading 10 cryptos by market capitalisation would
have equalled nearly $25,000 by the year-end. Despite the desire for
securitisation on the part of many investors in Blockchain assets as a result
of such huge increases in value, such actions are more likely to undermine
gains long term, and lead to funding droughts. Plus, purchasing securities
that are separately traded on regulated exchanges somewhat defeats the
original purpose of Blockchain investing.
Traditionally, Blockchain has been a haven for those who for one reason or
the other, do not wish to participate in the regulated financial exchanges. At
the same time, it is not viable to list securities on the Blockchain today since
the Blockchain, being a technology, fundamentally offers utility as a prime
feature whereas securities markets offer no utility at all except for the value
traded in them.
2.2 Generalized Development of Derivative Utility Tokens
If you put value-enhanced (e.g. dividend-paying, revenue share, asset
backed etc.) assets on the Blockchain, you run into 2 obstacles:
1) You may be creating a security under United States securities laws and
this asset may require registration before being sold
2) Even if you do register the asset it won’t fundamentally have any
constructive impact on the protocol on which it resides, the
Blockchain; possibly even, it will have a negative impact if this activity
is perpetuated
2.3 The Problem with Blockchain Securitisations
Blockchain holds the potential to enhance tremendous short-term value to
such an extent that many are using the payment ledger system purely for the
purpose of speculating on future payment utility trends. Due to the nascent
11
characteristic of the technology and the potential for mainstream worldwide
payment integration with adoption currently limited to a tiny fraction of the
population, speculative gains on Blockchain assets are proving to be
unbeatable across any other asset class.
Therefore, how do we harness future gains which may be set to continue at
an even more accelerated pace, while simultaneously in the process
contributing to the innovation of alternate payment utilities without detracting
from them in the form of Blockchain securitisation?
2.4 Blockchain-Based Utility Token Derivatives
Futereum has created a smart contract on the Ethereum network which
wherein tokens are mined according to a Fibonacci algorithm throughout 10
different stages (levels) where difficulty is measured primarily in the cost of
mining the new smart contract tokens. The new token, called the Futereum
(FUTR), is produced when Ethereum (ETH) tokens are sent to a smart
contract address. Once all the FUTRs are created by this process, depending
upon what period of time it has taken miners to produce all the available
FUTR tokens, the FUTR tokens will be entered into a swap with the ETH
which is stored securely in a smart contract for the duration of the FUTR
mining process and up until such an exchange takes place. The process then
begins anew.
Due to the fact that the process is ongoing permanently, with ETH and FUTR
tokens intermittently switching back and forth between one another, and the
addition of a Fibonacci equation in the mining algorithm, which miners of the
round’s initial FUTR tokens to obtain many more FUTRs than later ones (as
with classic Proof-of-work mining algorithms), there is both traditional
Blockchain payment utility in the issuance process as well as continuous
functionality of the asset exchange model, bypassing the requirement for
securitisation.
This bypass is achieved primarily via the implementation of core Blockchain
mining utility in the form a token wherein other alternate utilities can be
applied at a later date (such as community-building programs, development
of alternate product offerings etc.) but also in the permanent state of the
token as a Blockchain tool (i.e. it is not a contract with pre-functional
expiration, and it is one which is furthermore exchanged back and forth with
another non-securitised Blockchain asset).
At the same time, as a result of the addition of the Fibonacci sequence being
placed in a mining algorithm which is designed to function in a way that
operates similar to a forward swaps contract (futures contract) does in
commodity markets, FUTRs can be employed in numerous speculative and
12
price hedging events as a result of their financial markets equivalent
functionality. The resemblance of FUTRs to derivatives contracts is
remarkable, as FUTR tokens operate like leveraged bets on the price of the
asset which is used for payment and which is received back at the end of the
cycle of FUTR-ETH exchanges.
This is as a result of the earlier FUTR purchasers receiving a disproportionate
share of ETH at the point of exchange. For the late-comers, however, the
FUTR may offer a utility token alternative that is not solely dependent on ETH
price direction for miners of the current cycle’s FUTR tokens will be offered
an opportunity – either via employing FUTR tokens themselves in similar
gains or by means of having their mining addresses whitelisted – to
participate in similar new issuances of leveraged-style token utility with
respect to a wider variety of Blockchain assets. New releases will be
announced at the rate of approximately one per 5 completed levels of FUTR
mining by The Futereum Foundation’s core development team.
2.5 The Requirement for A Smart Contract Solution
For the past year at least, increasing numbers of teams pursuing initial coin
offerings (ICOs) have attempted to add value into their token sales nearly
always in the form of securitised traditional methods – either via offering
dividends to token buyers, or by promising to undertake token buybacks
using revenue shared with the funders of the ICO, or some such similar utility
to the Blockchain, and rather, these offerings seem to encourage a decrease
in net participation per capita of new entrants to the Blockchain in lieu of the
expectation of forthcoming returns created by management teams in the
same way as that which takes place on the stock market.
This is dangerous because left to its natural extent, net participation per
capita falls at an alarming rate when people are offered the chance of
financial returns for nothing more than their speculative monetary
contributions in a given project. At this point, the potential utility mechanisms
that are being created on Blockchain distributed ledger protocols will simply
die away. As a result, returns in digital asset markets will drop to less
dynamic levels and more importantly, as a result project funding will almost
completely dry up.
FUTRs are the first in a line of a number of unique value-enhanced utility
hybrid innovations that The Futereum Foundation aims to release in order to
serve the increasing numbers of financial speculators who are interested in
the high returns offered by Crypto, at the same time as maintaining a core
utility focus that consistently adds value to the underlying technology which
is enabling the foundation of all these gains – the Blockchain.
13
3.0 FUTR Overview
3.1 Description of FUTR
Futereum Utility Tokens are a first-of-a-kind marriage between financial
engineering and Blockchain engineering, and are the most appropriate
response to the recent introduction of these leveraged Blockchain-underlying
derivatives contracts introduced to the securities markets for the first time in
2017.
3.2 How Futereum Tokens Work
Futereum Tokens are placed into [Block*Token] structures and purchased
from a smart contract by Crypto investors. A smart contract issues new
tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain and as ETH is submitted to the smart
contract when it triggers the issuance of the new tokens. It is the same basic
concept employed in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) except it is ongoing even
after the ICO period and there is no fixed ICO.
In the case of an Futereum Token, Ethereum (ETH) triggers smart contract
sending out the Futereum Tokens to the same address which the Ethereum
came from, and the smart contract then captures and securely stores the
Ethereum tokens for a specified duration. At a date in the future comprising
13-37 months (depending on how quickly the levels become fully-mined, See
Sections 1.4 & 4.3) FUTR is then swapped back by the holder for a
commensurate amount of Ethereum percentage-wise as that which the FUTR
holder exchanges relative to the total supply of FUTR in circulation.
Month Level FUTR FUTR/ETH ETH
USD/ETH
(e) USD (Gross) USD/FUTR
Jan 1 1,000,000 114 8,772 $750 $6,578,947 $6.58
Jan 2 990,000 89 11,124 $750 $8,342,697 $8.43
Feb 3 960,000 55 17,455 $1,000 $17,454,545 $18.18

Mar 5 720,000 21 34,286 $1,500 $51,428,571 $71.43
Apr 6 650,000 13 50,000 $1,500 $75,000,000 $115.38
May 7 560,000 8 70,000 $2,000 $140,000,000 $250.00
June 8 450,000 5 90,000 $2,000 $180,000,000 $400.00
July 9 320,000 3 106,667 $2,500 $266,666,667 $833.33
July 10 170,000 2 85,000 $2,500 $212,500,000 $1,250.00
Dec Total 6,730,000 - 500,067 $18,000 $9,001,208,837 $1,337.48
For example, if there are 6.73 million FUTR in circulation, and the holder
exchanges 673,000 FUTR, then given a total of 197,908 ETH (not including
the 15.3% fees as per Section 1.3) stored in the smart contract, the holder
14
will receive back 19,791 ETH in exchange, irrespective of what price ETH was
at the point FUTR was mined or what price was paid for the FUTR on
exchange.
3.3 FUTRs vs ETH
The extent of the returns embedded in FUTR phi-based algorithmic mining is
easy to overlooked at first. What makes Futereum Tokens so profitable for
traders is that the value mining process is set up to take place over a series
of levels wherein progressively decreasing numbers of “blocks” containing
progressively increasing numbers of tokens per block are mined via an
equation which represents an exponential decrease in the number of
Futereum Tokens issued per ETH sent to the smart contract. As there
collects over time an exponentially falling number of tokens within each
block, over time value mining the Futereum Tokens becomes much harder
(more expensive) a la traditional POW or POS.
For holders of Futereum Tokens, any acceleration in the increase of Ethereum
market price is compounded for everyone – even for the very last
contingency of Futereum miners - so that by the time the contract swaps the
Futereum Tokens with Ethereum coins, Futereum token holders themselves
will simply be many more times profitable for the average investor than will
buying Ethereum itself.
3.4 Real-Life Hypothetical Example of FUTR Returns
In the example detailed in Figure 2 where 1 million Level 1 FUTRs are
purchased for $6.58 each at a gross cost of $6,578,947, we assume an
Ethereum price appreciation in 2018 that follows Bitcoin’s previous-year rise.
As a result of this substantial price increase combined with the Fibonacci
algorithm in the mining function of the FUTR, by January 2019 the same
FUTRs purchased for just shy of $7 million 12 months earlier could be
exchanged for $1.25 billion of ETH. This represents an uplift in value of nearly
19,000% vs. around 2300% for ETH over the same period.
3.5 Impact of Phi-Based Mining Algorithm with Pricing
Because the process of FUTR mining is set up in levels of difficulty wherein
progressively decreasing numbers of “blocks” containing progressively
increasing numbers of tokens per block are mined via an equation which
represents an exponential decrease in the number of Futereum Tokens
issued per ETH sent to the smart contract, for speculators who are confident
the ETH price is headed northwards FUTRs present a potentially incredibly
profitable option for early- and mid-stage players (Levels 1-8).
15
Even for late stage players, gains are likely to materialise without the level of
risk exposure a purchase of the underlying Ethereum tokens would
potentially leave a Crypto buyer. Over time an exponentially falling number of
tokens is mined within each block and the Futereum Tokens becomes
therefore much harder (more expensive) to mine as for Proof of Work coins.
Further, any acceleration in the increase of Ethereum market price is
compounded for everyone holding FUTRs – even for the very last
contingency of FUTR miners - so that by the point when the contract swaps
the FUTR with ETH, the vast majority of Futereum token holders. end up with
multiple times the profits than they would have buying just Ethereum.
3.6 Ultra-Efficient Payment Utility: the FUTR dollar (F$)
Core Blockchain utility is as a payment service. This is what Blockchain was
designed for by Satoshi and it is how the most effective Blockchain
innovations always work – primarily as alternative payment utilities. FUTR
offers a highly enhanced version of the core payment utility derived from
POW mining. This is because FUTR is mined on levels wherein the cost of
mining constantly fluctuates. Assume that in order to make revenue, a
website charges customers for goods and services but accepts FUTR.
To make this easy for customers to understand we have created a FUTR
dollar unit (F$). The F$ is not a token or a currency issued but rather an
algorithmic measurement of fluctuating value: F$1 is equal to the amount of
FUTR one ETH is currently mining at whatever level it is currently in. So for
example, F$1 in level 1 is 114 FUTR; in level 2 it is 89 FUTR etc. When the
mining cycle renews the algorithm takes over so the amount of F$1
decreases to 1.3 FUTR in what would become level 11 if there was one.
At least at first, what is the difference between a F$ and an ETH? The answer
lies in whether the FUTR is about to be mined or is already mined. For once
the FUTR has been mined then it is the F$ that becomes the relevant
denominator of value for payment, not the ETH. For example, if the customer
mines F$1 for 1 ETH in level 1 in order to pay for a service that costs this
much, if he waits until level 2 in order to make payment then F$1 is only 89
FUTR, and hence he has made a real saving of 28% for this short wait.
By harnessing derivative utility, whereby mining becomes more or less
expensive to do partly as a result of the ETH price and partly as a result of
the mining level, FUTR offers merchants and service providers a way to
charge less to their customers even as they potentially receive more in return.
Note that this is a more ambitious product roll-out that is likely to have a
number of unintended consequences and effects, and as such, this will not
take priority over the other aspects of this White Paper.

4.0 How Futereum Smart Contract Works
4.1 ERC20 Compatibility
The Futereum smart contract is an ERC20 compatible token contract. It also
dispenses tokens and safely holds an Ether balance until it is time to
dispense Ether.
4.2 Mining FUTR
Accepts Ether transferred to the contract address
(0xc83355eF25A104938275B46cffD94bF9917D0691) and immediately
dispenses FUTR tokens according to the current tier. Note the following:
This function consumes more gas than a normal transfer. You must use a
wallet that supports ERC20 tokens that you control. Do NOT use an
exchange wallet.
4.3 Storing Ether
The Ether remains in the Smart Contract and the fees are deducted. The
remaining Ether balance cannot be removed. There are also no self-destruct
methods on the contract. The Ether remains until the deadline is passed.
4.4 Checking the Deadline
Each time a token is transferred, the time Is checked against the end time. If
12 months passes and the tiers are not filled, the deadline is extended to 36
months.

4.5 Wait Period
When the deadline is reached, the contract then waits for 1 month. Neither
Ether nor FUTR is dispensed during this period.
4.6 Dispensing Ether
When the deadline is reached, the contract accepts FUTR tokens transferred
to its address (0xc83355eF25A104938275B46cffD94bF9917D0691), burns
the tokens, and dispenses Ether. Do NOT use an exchange wallet.

5.0 Assumptions for FUTR Gas Costs
5.1 Gas Costs
We have tried to reduce gas costs were possible, however, given that this
process is largely automated, the transfer and fallback (mining) functions
require some additional gas in some cases.
5.2 Transfer Gas
We recommend transferring using a method that calculates gas for you.
Here are some estimates (not guaranteed to be accurate):
• It usually costs around 37k gas. It cost more if the state changes.
• State change during transfers make the transfer cost around 55k - 65k
gas.
• Swapping tokens for ether costs around 46k gas. (around 93k for the
first account to swap)
5.3 Mining Gas
Transferring ether to the contract triggers the fallback function that mines the
tokens. We recommend transferring using a method that calculates gas for
you.
Here are some estimates (not guaranteed to be accurate):
• It usually costs around 90k gas. It cost more if you cross a tier.
• Maximum is around 190k gas.
• Note: Transfer from a wallet you control. DON'T send from an
exchange wallet!

6.0 FUTR Technical Commands
6.1 Smart Contract Selected Function Descriptions
Unnamed (fallback) Function
The fallback function is called when you transfer Ether to the contract address
(0xc83355eF25A104938275B46cffD94bF9917D0691). It requires more gas
that a normal transfer because it calculates the tiers, the FUTR token
amounts, and dispenses the FUTR tokens.
transfer Function
This is a ERC20 standard transfer function. It has 2 additional capabilities:
• It checks the state of the contract based on the time and the tiers. It
changes the state as necessary.
• It handles the sending of tokens directly to the contract address
(0xc83355eF25A104938275B46cffD94bF9917D0691) when it is in the
Ether dispensing state.
tier Function
Returns the last completed tier.
currentTier Function
Returns the current tier (this is the value of tier + 1) unless tier 10 is complete.
This is for convenience.
endTime Function
Returns time of the next deadline (in Epoch time). This is updated for each
different state.
The length of each period (from contract creation time) is:
Dispensing Tokens 12 months
Dispensing Extended 36 months
Wait 1 month
Swap Tokens for Ether 5 days
extended Function
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the token dispensing period has
been extended because all tiers were not filled in 12 months.
wait Function
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the contract state is in the 1
month waiting period before the swap.
20
swap Function
Returns a Boolean value indicating whether you can send tokens in for ether.
restart Function
Restarts contract. Token holders retain their tokens. Anyone can call this
function. It can only be called after the swap period is over.
payFees Function
Pays any outstanding fees to the foundation and other addresses. Anyone
can call this function.
6.2 Events
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);
Standard ERC20 Transfer event. Also logged when tokens are mined.
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint
_value);
Standard ERC20 Approval event.
event Mined(address indexed _miner, uint _value);
Logged when FUTR tokens are mined.
event WaitStarted(uint256 endTime);
Wait period before swap has started. The end of the wait period is logged.
event SwapStarted(uint256 endTime);
The token swap to dispense Ether has started. The end of the swap period is
logged.
event MiningStart(uint256 end_time, uint256 swap_time, uint256
swap_end_time);
Token mining has started.
event MiningExtended(uint256 end_time, uint256 swap_time, uint256
swap_end_time);
Token mining has been extended because the tiers were not filled.

7.0 FUTR, Utility & Non-Securitisation
7.1 3 Essential Characteristics of Securitised Product Design
Within securities markets, there are three forms of value one identifies on a
regular basis: core value (net asset value), which is the price as asset is worth
at the break-up/fire sale point, exchange value/market value, the price one
may obtain for the security on an exchange or in the process of exchanging it
for some form of alternate value (usually FIAT), and derivative value, the price
of an asset’s value relative to that alternate asset or function which it is
representing.
7.2 Value & Utility Typology of Marked-Traded Instruments
All 3 values listed above might be at any one time completely different. For
instance, a company’s core value might be $1 billion, it’s market value
possibly may be even higher – possibly up to twenty times or more so - being
predicated on its earnings forecast. The company’s derived value would be
the difference between the core value of the asset and the exchangeable
value.
If for example a company was pegged to earn $50m on $1 billion of assets
and it traded for a P/E of 50x earnings, its core value is $1 billion, it’s
exchange value is $2.5 billion and its derived value is $1.5 billion.
A similar test can be applied to payment utility, except in the case of utility
assets there is no connection between the core utility and the derived utility
other than that process whereby the core utility of the asset can be
engineered to produce an alternate – and reflective – type of payment utility.
7.3 3 Value-Equivalent Utilities for Non-Securitised Assets
If we map the FUTR’s three types of utility as we did for the value
constructions of a hypothetical security, it becomes clearer where the lack of
securitisation is evident in FUTR tokens:
Core Utility – For use within the ecosystem belonging to The Futereum
Foundation, such as whitelisting future product launches, participating in
community events etc.
Exchange Utility – The utility derived from buying and selling FUTRs against
Bitcoin, Ethereum, DOGE etc. on exchanges such as Cryptopia and Binance
Derived Utility – A reverse-exchange utility in the sense in which it is applied:
instead of being an exchange utility where the FUTR is sold for a sum of
Ethereum (whereby it is used as a mechanism of payment for such
22
Ethereum), here the token is swapped for a utility it has previously derived
from at some point in an earlier event (in this case the example references the
mining of the FUTR itself which is swapped back for the ETH that mined it).
7.4 Applying the Howey Test to Utility Derivatives
It is clear from the utility mapping exercise performed above that core utility
and exchange utility function very similarly to their value counterparts.
However, in the case of derived utility, there is no fundamental linkage
between any sort of valuation process and the functionality of the token
whatsoever – rather, derived utility is merely a more advanced form of
exchange utility, whereby an exchange has taken place at some point in the
past and is then re-enacted. For the derived utility to have security status, it
must meet one of the following conditions of the HOWEY test:
• It must be an investment of money
• There must be an expectation of profits from the investment
• The investment of money is in a common enterprise
• Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party
First, there is no investment of money at the outset, but rather a mining of
FUTR with the use of ETH. Second, although there may be an expectation of
profit on the part of the FUTR miner, that being at the point of the reexchange
of the FUTR with the ETH used originally to mine the FUTR or via
sale of the FUTR on a major crypto exchange where it is listed, it is not the
foremost reason for the token purchase.
FUTR is purchased to take advantage of future products offered by The
Futereum Foundation for which ownership of FUTR – and especially, early
ownership of FUTR – is given considerable preference. If FUTR by means of
being re-exchanged with the ETH in the smart contract yields a capital gain
at the end of the term of the current 10-level mining round then this is
fortuitous. It is worth noting that there are not even any profits yielded as a
result of any of the abovementioned transactions either, since there was no
initial “investment of money” in the first place. As for the third point, this is
clearly a non-sequitur here.
Insofar as the fourth point is concerned, The Futereum Foundation does not
receive any portion of any profit. It receives a flat fee paid in ETH at the point
at which the FUTR is mined. The foundation receives compensation for its
services providing the development and product advancement of Futereum
tokens long before there is any evidence of the FUTR miners being able to
capitalise materially on their FUTRs. (They would be vale to of course either
as a result of exercising the exchange utility or the derivative utility inherent in
the token.)

8.0 Foundation Revenue Treatment
For every ETH received, the Foundation holds a multi-signature for the
purpose of effecting any urgently in demand any technical issues. At the
point when FUTR is mined, a one-off fee of 15.3% is subtracted from the
smart contract pool of ETH employed in the mining process.
Half of this pool of revenue will be used towards paying for research and
development of the Foundation’s project(s); a quarter of the pool will be used
by the Foundation to invest in external businesses / Blockchain / projects,
especially into areas where there may be future synergy with respect to the
growth of the Foundation’s product offerings and / or involvement in
developing Blockchain applications in general; an additional quarter of all
revenue remains left over in the form of savings.
Out of this revenue the Foundation may at times employ the ETH received in
the process of mining its own FUTR-based tokens as well as in providing
investment capital for ; this type of investment capital for venture capital
funds and projects with similar interests.

9.0 Roadmap
9.1 Notes for Roadmap
1. FUTR-A and FUTR-B are generic names for a next-generation
Futereum product launch and not the name of the actual tokens
2. This is an approximate one-year plan. After the period following two
subsequent successful product launches, depending on market
Jan 1 – Feb 1: Pre-exchange
mining for FUTR
Feb 2: List on one exchange
Feb 3 – Mar 31: FUTR listed on 2x
more exchanges.
Feb 3 – Mar 31: If during
this period Level 5 is
completed, early FUTR-A
mining opportunity will
open for anyone who has
mined a min. of 1,000
FUTR thus far
July 1 – Aug 2: Preexchange
mining for
FUTR-A (no min. holding)
Aug 2: FUTR-A will list on one
exchange
Oct 3 – Dec 31: If during this
period Level 8 is completed, early
FUTR-B mining opportunity will
open for anyone who has mined a
min. of 10,000 FUTR thus far
Jan 1 – Feb 1: Pre-exchange
mining for FUTR-B
Feb 2: FUTR-B will list on one
exchange
Feb 3 – Mar 31: FUTR-B listed on
2x more exchanges.
Oct 3– Dec 31: FUTR-A
will list on 2x more
exchanges.
25
conditions at the time, we may launch a FUTR-C product but the
product launch dates have not yet been planned. We will announce
them during the course of 2018
3. Futereum does not guarantee that these deadlines will be accurately
maintained. The annual roadmap illustrated here serves as a guideline
only of intended product launch only and is subject to the influence
and timing of external events (e.g. severe changes in market direction /
conditions)
4. After FUTR-ETH swap takes place the process begins anew
9.2 Five Possible FUTR Scenarios For ETH
The following are 5 highly plausible scenarios for ETH in coming 12 months.
We forecast a pretty substantial amount of value churn and generalised
boosting of highly-integrated software platforms such as ETH, EOS, ICON
etc. We also forecast a high volume in FUTR towards the more difficult end of
the mining period for the reasons described herein.
Scenario 1: ETH begins a late-year rise like Bitcoin had in 2017 and
FUTR miners in the late levels begin to aggressively mine FUTR in order
to get whitelisted for other Futereum product releases and in order to
activate the swap on month 13. If Ethereum is rising as fro Bitcoin in late
2017 in the Q418 period and miners snap up the last lots of FUTR in order to
take advantage of soaring ETH – and by extension FUTR – prices, then the
resultant increase in value for Level 1 stage miners comes to around
19,000% in a 12-month period by the end of January 2018.
Scenario 2: Level 8-10 FUTR miners do not swap but instead leave a
significant portion of the Ether inside the smart contract to roll over for
the subsequent year. If this is the case then there will be an additional
781,733 ETH left in the smart contract the following year for swapping. At
Bitcoin’s current price, that is approximately $2,006.83 per FUTR. This
scenario would justify a $14 billion valuation for FUTR in issue, making it the
world’s 10th largest Crypto by market cap in current circumstances. The
return for Level 1 miners in this scenario rises to 33,233%.
Scenario 3: All the FUTR is mined prior to July 2017 and the Ether price
touches $18,000 per ETH in 2018. In this scenario, it is likely that if
continued price appreciation were dominant that a large portion of FUTR
holders would exchange at the end of the month 13. However, there is a
good chance that either: no exchange would take place for a large portion of
FUTR as the FUTR holders aimed to mine the early levels of the subsequent
mining cycle or that there would be a massive price drop around the time of
26
the exchange. If the latter were the case then likely the FUTR price would
drop from $1500 to around $400 in the mid-term, presenting an attractive
entry point for buyers.
Scenario 4: A hedge fund with a view that Ether is likely to touch $18,000
later in the year mines all levels 8-10 and then subsequently mines most
of levels 1-5 of the following mining cycle. If the hedge fund in question
was to make such purchases they would come to between $300m - $1
billion. While these sound like large numbers, by speculating on Ether itself
the fund would stand to gain about 5 -6 times the amount of FIAT in the
event that the trade was successful. The FUTR mining option described
however presents the fund with a much more attractive alternative; a smart
contract which has a liquid market on a major Crypto exchange and which
exchanges to Ether at the point of delivery (most likely at the end of the
second cycle after 24 months) with a return of $98 billion. There is simply no
other way an institutional investor could expect such a large return on such a
liquid basis Crypto or in any other asset class without assuming extra debt
and costs.
Scenario 5: ETH rises in value to $2000 before plummeting to around
$400 at Level 7. By Level 10 at the year-end ETH price has regained to
$4000. This scenario would mean that 98.5% of miners from levels 1 – 10
would be in profit which would not necessarily be the same case were they
holding underlying ETH that they sold out in the interim. Miners who stood to
make the most money would be those early-stage miners who continued to
mine FUTR while ETH fell back. For instance, a miner who mined FUTR every
other Level from the first Level until the penultimate one would end up in
such a case with a roughly 2000% return on an underlying asset that had
increased just 500% in value after falling to 50% of its present-day value for
half the year. The scenario illustrates well how FUTR can not only be
employed in generating alpha coefficient returns but furthermore, how when
it is used in strategic repurchase plans it actually protects Crypto buyers from
market downturns by magnifying potential upside
27
10.0 Blockchain Utility Derivatives
The presence of simultaneous leveraged value characteristic and complete
lack of securitisation of The Futereum Token is what we believe to be the
FUTRs most innovative quality.
We foresee the foundation building substantially in the future on top of
multiple Crypto products and applications utilising such a model as it
functions just like any exchange-traded POW currency, with a fixed cost base
that progressively rises, while simultaneously enhancing by many multiples
over the performance of the potential returns of the holder versus a
prospective holding in the referenced Crypto employed in mining it and
thereby setting such cost.
All the while, value is held in a non-securitised form in a secure smart
contract. We believe it is this sort of function for which a smart contract was
designed; that is to say, for the enhancement of value production via a new
utility discovery and not purely for the purpose of safety in fundraising as it is
more commonly used in ICOs today.
